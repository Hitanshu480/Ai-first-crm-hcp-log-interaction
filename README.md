AI-First CRM – HCP Log Interaction Module
 Overview

This project implements an AI-first CRM Log Interaction screen for Healthcare Professionals (HCPs).
Unlike traditional CRMs, the form is never filled manually. All interaction data is captured, corrected, and managed only through an AI Assistant using LangGraph and LLMs.

The system is designed from a life sciences field representative perspective, focusing on accuracy, compliance, and usability.
